## 1. Introduction of StromEvent Data set

Description of Data Set - Storm Event

The NCEI Storm Events Database contains various types of storm reports searchable by state, county, date, and event type from 1950 to the present. These data are received from National Weather Service. National Weather receives these data from various sources : Social media, NWS employee, broadcast media, etc. 

These data documents the occurrence of storms and other weather phenomenon such as flood, drought, avalanche, tornado etc. which can cause the significant damage, injuries and death. These data can be useful in studying the frequencies and occurrence of these weather phenomenons, damages (property & crops), fatalities (injuries & death), magnitude, categories, damage scale of tornado, flood cause etc. chronologically. These can be used for information and analysis by business sectors, insurance companies, hazard mitigator, policy makers etc. 




The Rawdataset can be found [here](https://github.com/vrahangdale/ISQA_8086-TeamProject/tree/master/RawDataset)    

## 2. Draft Research Question

1. What is the average duration of each event such as hail, tornado, etc. for each month?
2. Which state is having maximum injuries/deaths with each event?
3. What is the average distance covered and area affected by each type of event?
4. Which event is more likely to occur on the basis of month (monthwise occurrence)?
5. What is estimated amount of damage (damage property & damage crops) caused by each event? which event is most likely to cause maximum damage?
6. Which event is the most severe taking into consideration both fatalities and damage?

## 3. Project Timeline

* The Project Timeline is used for estimation of time and effort required to complete the required deliverables described in project guidelines and requirements of this project.
* Total estimated time to complete this project with all deliverables is 51.4 = 52 days.
* The project timeline includes the tasks identification, the time and effort required for completion and the duration of the entire project. Projectlibre software was used for making the Gantt chart. Gantt Chart of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/vrahangdale/ISQA_8086-TeamProject/blob/master/Deliverables/WorkPlan-%20RQs/GanttChart.pdf)

## 5. Target Audience
  * Climate data is used by scientists in their research and analysis of past, current, and future climate change. But today, the information is also  commonly used by the policy makers to make informed strategies to prevent and adapt to climate change, and the scientists also recommend the increased availablity of data to public to reduce their vulnerability to climatic changes.
